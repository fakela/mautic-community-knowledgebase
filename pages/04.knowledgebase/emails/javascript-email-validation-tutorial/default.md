Email Validation is a method to check, authenticate and prove the accuracy and validity of emails. Emails is one of the most convenient and popular means of communication used by a lot of people - the need to validate emails is very important as it is: 
1. Improve the quality of data; By validating emails, you can ascertain the accuracy of data as only accurate and valid emails are collected, a large amount of invalid email addresses means there is a lot to improve.
2. Improves email marketing: Validation of emails improves email marketing as only deliverable emails are being targeted when sending emails out.
3. Leads to increased deliverability: When emails are validated you donâ€™t get to deal with issues that arise with sending out incorrect or invalid emails such as high spam complaint rate.
4. Prevents email hard bounce: Email bounces occur when the recipient email address is not correct or the email does not exist. Email validation cleans up the list of emails and removes invalid or incorrect emails.

6. Saves money: Sending emails out cost money, email validation eliminates unwanted emails leaving only relevant emails and thereby reducing expenses.
